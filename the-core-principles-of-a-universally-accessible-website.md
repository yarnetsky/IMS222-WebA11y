# The four principles of universally accessible websites \(POUR\)

Universal access to your web content relies on several components working together...

* **Your content** - It all starts with your content— from your text to images and multimedia. If your content is not written or coded correctly, your reader will not be able to comprehend your content.
* **User agents** - A user agent is the software people use to access your web content. This could be any device including a desktop or mobile/tablet web browsers, ebook readers, multimedia players, browser plug-ins, and assistive technologies such as screen readers that read aloud web pages.
* **Authoring tools** - These are tools to create web content. This could be anything from our code editor to a web content manager such as WordPress. It's also the content we embed in our websites from sources such as Instagram, YouTube, or Twitter. 

If any of these fail, your reader can miss the intended meaning of your content. Your reader loses and so do you because the failure prevents your ability to communicate.

To help you navigate what is required to make your work accessible, there are four principles which go by the acronym POUR— _perceivable_, _operable_, _understandable_, and _robust_. These principals each cover a lot of ground, but come together to outline what's needed to make your site universally accessible.

Two important notes. First, there are official national and international standards that play a vital role in the requirements for each of these components. Secondly, while some of these requirements are easy to meet, others require technical skills or advanced knowledge of how people use the Web. However, being aware of 

## Perceivable

Everyone should be able to identify and use the content you intend to share with your website. They should also be able to identify and use your website's interface elements \(such as drop-down menus\). For many this means perceiving is primarily visually, while for others, the perception may be via sound or touch. 

Key methods for fulfilling this include...

### Text alternatives for non-text content such as images and multimedia

Good examples include closed captioning and/or transcripts for video or audio material, description of images and charts, and labels for interactive elements of your site \(such as forms and search buttons\).

### Content can be presented in different ways

Structuring your HTML properly helps a range of user agents— from mobile phones to assistive technologies — properly display your content. If your headings, lists, tables, forms, and content are marked-up properly, then your content could be correctly read aloud, enlarged, or adapted to meet the needs and preferences of different people.

### Content is easier to see and hear

The goal here is to help people distinguish important information on your site whether they are using a desktop web browser or a screen reader using a Braille-readout. For example, we want to ensure...

* Color is not the only means of conveying information or identifying content
* The foreground and background color combinations provide sufficient contrast
* Our content is still readable when a person drastically enlarges the text
* That our content reflows well on small screens such as cellphones.
* Users can control the playing and volume of audio

## Operable 

This means anyone can successfully use the controls, buttons, navigation, and other interactive elements of your website. For example, most users can see the controls for an image carousel and click the forward and reverse buttons. Others however, also need to be able to control the carousel with a keyboard or voice commands. Our coding needs to ensure both can occur. Here are the goals...

### Your site needs to be functional from a keyboard

Many people do not use the mouse and rely on the keyboard to interact with the Web. This means your entire website interface — from forms to dropdown menus — need to be keyboard accessible. Proper coding of your page also helps people using voice recognition to operate websites.

### Users have enough time to read and use the content

Many sites rotate through content on a timer or timeout when an action does not take place quickly enough. However, some people need more time to read, use the content, type text, or operate controls. For these users it's critical we provide means of stopping or extending time limits, and pausing content.

### Content does not cause seizures and physical reactions

Content that flashes at certain rates or patterns can cause photosensitive reactions, including seizures. Flashing content is ideally avoided entirely or only used in a way that does not cause known risks. If the flashing is unavoidable, include warnings and provide mechanisms to switch off animations.

### Users can easily navigate, find content, and determine where they are

Well organized content helps users to orient themselves and to navigate effectively. Such content includes:

* Pages have clear titles and are organized using descriptive section headings
* There is more than one way to find relevant pages within a set of web pages
* Users are informed about their current location within a set of related pages
* There are ways to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple pages
* The keyboard focus is visible, and the focus order follows a meaningful sequence
* The purpose of a link is evident, ideally even when the link is viewed on its own

Meeting this requirement helps people to navigate through web pages in different ways, depending on their particular needs and preferences. For instance, while some people rely on hierarchical navigation structures such as menu bars to find specific web pages, others rely on search functions on websites instead. Some people may be seeing the content while others may be hearing it or seeing and hearing it at the same time. Some people may be using the content with only a mouse or a keyboard, while others may be using both.

#### Users can use input methods beyond the keyboard <a id="modalities"></a>

Input methods beyond keyboard, such as touch, voice recognition, and gestures make content easier to use for many people. Yet not everyone can use each of these input methods. Some of the ways you can do this is providing alternative methods of input, especially is gestures require fine movement; and providing undo functionality if accidental activation is possible, 

* Functionality that is activated by movement can also be activated through user interface components
* Buttons, links, and other active components are large enough to make them easier to activate by touch

Meeting this requirement makes the content easier to use for many people with a wide range of abilities using a wide range of devices. This includes content used on mobile phones, tablet computers, and self-service terminals such as ticketing machines.

## Understandable 

"Understandable technology is consistent in its presentation and format, predictable in its design and usage patterns, concise, multimodal, and appropriate to the audience in its voice and tone. Users should be able to comprehend the content, and learn and remember how to use the interface."

### Text is readable and understandable

Content authors need to ensure that text content is readable and understandable to the broadest audience possible, including when it is read aloud by text-to-speech. Such content includes:

* Identifying the primary language of a web page, such as Arabic, Dutch, or Korean
* Identifying the language of text passages, phrases, or other parts of a web page
* Providing definitions for any unusual words, phrases, idioms, and abbreviations
* Using the clearest and simplest language possible, or providing simplified versions

Meeting this requirement helps software, including assistive technology, to process text content correctly. For instance, this requirement helps software to read the content aloud, to generate page summaries, and to provide definitions for unusual words such as technical jargon. It also helps people who have difficulty understanding more complex sentences, phrases, and vocabulary. In particular, it helps people with different types of cognitive disabilities.

### Content appears and operates in predictable ways

Many people rely on predictable user interfaces and are disoriented or distracted by inconsistent appearance or behavior. Examples of making content more predictable include:

* Navigation mechanisms that are repeated on multiple pages appear in the same place each time
* User interface components that are repeated on web pages have the same labels each time
* Significant changes on a web page do not happen without the consent of the user

Meeting this requirement helps people to quickly learn the functionality and navigation mechanisms provided on a website, and to operate them according to their specific needs and preferences. For instance, some people assign personalized shortcut keys to functions they frequently use to enhance keyboard navigation. Others memorize the steps to reach certain pages or to complete processes on a website. Both rely on predictable and consistent functionality.

### Users are helped to avoid and correct mistakes

Forms and other interaction can be confusing or difficult to use for many people, and, as a result, they may be more likely to make mistakes. Examples of helping users to avoid and correct mistakes include:

* Descriptive instructions, error messages, and suggestions for correction
* Context-sensitive help for more complex functionality and interaction
* Opportunity to review, correct, or reverse submissions if necessary

Meeting this requirement helps people who do not see or hear the content, and may not recognize implicit relationships, sequences, and other cues. It also helps people who do not understand the functionality, are disoriented or confused, forget, or make mistakes using forms and interaction for any other reason.

## Robust 

If you do the above, your content becomes more compatible with current and future tools. It ensures your markup is compatible with different browsers, assistive technologies, and other user agents. 

"Robust I.T. is standards-compliant, and designed to function on all appropriate technologies. Users should be able to choose the technology they use to interact with websites, online documents, multimedia, and other information formats."

In accessibility circles, we often talk about compatibility with assistive technologies, but we also need to keep our content usable for the future "Internet of Things." Will your refrigerator be able to read a recipe and compare it to the contents of your refrigerator? If you recipe is marked up properly today, then it should be robust enough to succeed.

"POUR principles were developed to describe web accessibility, but they can be applied to almost any accessibility question. Technology providers must ensure that their users all can perceive, operate, and understand their technology, and that the technology is robust enough to work across a spectrum of technologies, including assistive technology."

Web accessibility has a set of standards called the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG 2.1\)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). It has dozens of specifications on topics from headers and links to colors and images. To better understand the intent of these specifications, let's group them into three goals.
