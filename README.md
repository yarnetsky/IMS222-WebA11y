It has dozens of specifications on topics from headers and links to colors and images. While making advanced web accessibility may require development experience, making the basic content we all create accessible can be accomplished by us all.

### What we'll learn

In this module, we will focus on the content aspects of our website as those are the easiest to encode. Content is also
