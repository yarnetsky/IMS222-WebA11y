# Introduction to WebA11y

### Universal access has greater than expected benefits

We often think of web accessibility as special encoding required so people who are blind or deaf can understand the content of our websites. This is true to an extent, but also misses the fact that a well-constructed website benefits all web users on multiple levels. Closed captioning for web video is one example...

* For a person living with hearing loss, reading closed captions makes understanding the spoken words and audible content easy.
* A person who has difficulty differentiating spoken words from background noise can also benefit.
* People who love overseas television like captions as they can better understand accents.
* Captions also help when the sound quality of the video itself suffers from being made with non-professional equipment or being streamed over slower cell networks.

In all these instances captioning walks in for the win and this is just one example of how using assistive technologies can benefit everyone. 

### **Fear not, the basics are easy**

Web accessibility has a set of standards called the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG 2.1\)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). There are dozens of specifications on topics ranging from color contrast to properly encoding interactive interface elements such as dropdown menus. While advanced web accessibility may require development experience, making the basic content we all create accessible can be accomplished by us all.

### What we'll learn

In part one we'll review the four guiding principles of universal access, how content is perceived with assistive technologies, and introduce a simple testing tool.

In part two we'll get into the details of how to structure your HTML so your web content is readily understood using assistive technology.

Finally, our appendices include notes on making accessible documents in non-HTML formats and links for more information. 

### Footnote

What's with the name? A11y is a numeronym for accessibility â€” 11 letters between the A and Y. It also looks like ally which means we support providing full access of the web for everyone.
