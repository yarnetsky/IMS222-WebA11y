# Introduction

### Universal access has greater than expected benefits

A person with hearing loss can obviously benefit from closed captioned video. But so can a person who has difficulty differentiating spoken words from background noise. Everyone can benefit when many videos are made with non-professional equipment and streamed over slower cell networks where the sound quality of the video itself can suffer. In all these instances captioning walks in for the win!

### **People with a wide range of needs use assistive technologies**



### **We're legally obliged to create universally accessible sites**

For example, [dozens of colleges and universities across the United States are facing legal action](https://www.d.umn.edu/~lcarlson/atteam/lawsuits.html) over inaccessible technology and online resources. Having accessible content from the point of creation can save extensive time and effort spent on accessibility remediation \(and potentially save legal costs as well\).

### **Fear not, the basics are easy**

While making advanced web accessibility may require development experience, making the basic content we all create accessible can be accomplished by us all.

### What we'll learn

The contents at left do a fair job outlining what we'll cover in this module.
