# Introduction to WebA11y

### Universal access has greater than expected benefits

When we think of web accessibility, we often think of special encoding required so people who are blind or deaf can understand the content of our website. This is true to an extent, but miss. However, a well-constructed website benefits  all web users on multiple levels. Here's just one example...

* A person living with hearing loss can benefit from seeing closed captions on video convey the spoken words in text. 
* A person who has difficulty differentiating spoken words from background noise can also benefit.
* People who love overseas television like captions to better understand accents. 
* Sound quality of the video itself can suffer if it was made with non-professional equipment or streamed over slower cell networks.

In all these instances captioning walks in for the win!

That's just one example of how using assistive technologies can benefit everyone. 

### **People with a wide range of needs use assistive technologies**

### **We're legally obliged to create universally accessible sites**

For example, [dozens of colleges and universities across the United States are facing legal action](https://www.d.umn.edu/~lcarlson/atteam/lawsuits.html) over inaccessible technology and online resources. Having accessible content from the point of creation can save extensive time and effort spent on accessibility remediation \(and potentially save legal costs as well\).

### **Fear not, the basics are easy**

Web accessibility has a set of standards called the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG 2.1\)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). It has dozens of specifications on topics from headers and links to colors and images. To better understand the intent of these specifications, let's group them into three goals.

While making advanced web accessibility may require development experience, making the basic content we all create accessible can be accomplished by us all.

### What we'll learn

### Footnote

What's with the name? A11y is a numeronym for accessibility â€” 11 letters between the A and Y. It also looks like ally which means we support providing full access of the web for everyone.
