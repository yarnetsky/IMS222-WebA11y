# Introduction to WebA11y

### Universal access has greater than expected benefits

Websites constructed to allow full access benefit everyone on multiple levels.

A person with hearing loss can obviously benefit from closed captioned video. But so can a person who has difficulty differentiating spoken words from background noise. People who love overseas television like captions to better understand accents. Everyone can benefit when videos are often made with non-professional equipment and are streamed over slower cell networks. Closed captions support viewing when the sound quality of the video itself can suffer. In all these instances captioning walks in for the win!

That's just one example of how using assistive technologies can benefit everyone. 

### **People with a wide range of needs use assistive technologies**

### **We're legally obliged to create universally accessible sites**

For example, [dozens of colleges and universities across the United States are facing legal action](https://www.d.umn.edu/~lcarlson/atteam/lawsuits.html) over inaccessible technology and online resources. Having accessible content from the point of creation can save extensive time and effort spent on accessibility remediation \(and potentially save legal costs as well\).

### **Fear not, the basics are easy**

Web accessibility has a set of standards called the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG 2.1\)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). It has dozens of specifications on topics from headers and links to colors and images. To better understand the intent of these specifications, let's group them into three goals.

While making advanced web accessibility may require development experience, making the basic content we all create accessible can be accomplished by us all.

### What we'll learn

The contents at left do a fair job outlining what we'll cover in this module.



### Footnote

What's with the name? A11y is a numeronym for accessibility \(11 letters between the A and Y\), but it also looks like ally which means we support providing full access of the web for everyone.
